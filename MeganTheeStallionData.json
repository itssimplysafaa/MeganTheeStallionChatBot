    "And I need to be calling y'all. Y'all need to be calling me. Definitely can't live without her. I actually have like four phones. But, this is the main one.\n",
    "And my other one, actually my other three are dead all the time I don't, I don't even know where they are right now, honestly like, the other phones, I don't even know the phone numbers to.\n",
    "I've literally had my number since, maybe the 6th grade, so everybody calls this phone all the time. These are jalapeño kettle chips, and they're not just regular jalapeño kettle chips.\n",
    "They are 'Kettle' brand jalapeño chips. And these are legit the best tasting chips that I've ever had in my life. I literally ask for a bag of these chips all the time.\n", 
    "So, all my hotel room are like filled up with these. Like all my rooms backstage are like full of kettle chips.\n They're just bomb! Like you know when you're eating a bag of hot Cheetos and you got like all the fire, like, little crumbs at the end?\n",
    "That's how I feel about this, like I will literally lick all 10 of my fingers. To get all the flavor off of them from these chips. I definitely can not live without my Beats. I have at least three pairs of these.\n",
    "I write everywhere I go, so I'm literally just all day long with my beats on my head. And the speakers are just like super high quality. I feel like I'm in the studio.\n",
    "I'm not the girl that likes Air Pods because I will lose them, and they will fall out, and I will never see them again. So these are big enough, I can find them. Can't lose these!\n",
    "But yeah, I like super love these because they're super loud, I listen to music really high. So, gotta have my Beats. Actually, sometimes I write before I get a beat.\n",
    "So, a lot of the times when I get the instrumental, 9 times out of 10 I already knew what I was gonna say. I was just looking for the perfect beat to fit my words to. But a lot of the times when I do get instrumentals.\n",
    "I'm like this is bringing this type of energy out of meso, then I start writing to that and then when I hear a beat that I really like I'm writing to it every day, all day. I'm listening to it at any time. I'm listening to it at the most random times.\n",
    "So, I gotta have these all day. My next item is my lip gloss, clear lip gloss, at that it's like the perfect top coat for everything. And I really like this one by Revlon because I don't know it's just super thick.\n",
    "And I really like thick gloss. I need gloss that's gonna stay on my lips through eight bags of chips I need gloss that's gonna stay on my lips all day.\n",
    "This is just like the perfect top coat, and I literally hate for my lips to be dry. Anytime you see me, my lips gonna be looking real juicy, real glassy, that's why I need.\n My clear lip gloss. The next thing I definitely can't be on this Earth without, is water.\n",
    "It's literally my favorite thing. Water makes you feel good, water makes you smell good. Water makes you taste good. Well no, water's just good for your body so I just feel like I always gotta have it.\n",
    "I'm always performing, I'm always running around. You know when you're on the go, you just gotta make sure you stay hydrated. Uh, last year I feel like I wasn't drinking enough water,and uh, like when you don't drink a lot of water it could really mess with your skin.\n",
    "So ever since then, I've been like improving with how much water I put in my body.I feel like I've been glowing. So yeah, got to get the water. 4oe! You don't hear your momma talking to you?\n",
    "Hello! The next beautiful thing that I cannot live without is my son, Fourie-worie. Say, hi. He was a gift, and you know he's just been my little blessing ever since. He's gonna be turning one next month.\n",
    "I'm just a proud mother I literally, I take 4oe everywhere like there. There is not a place that you will see me without 4oe. And everybody knows that. Yes, 4oe goes everywhere. They need to start getting him his own dressing room at this point.\n",
    "Because he's famous, like people don't even run up on me. They run up on 4oe.They're like, 'Oh my god Fourie-worie!'And I'm like, 'Yeah, he's a little superstar.' Next is Anime, I literally begin my day watching anime and I end my day watching anime.\n",
    "When I'm doing my make-up. I'll have it playing in the background, and then before I go to sleep at night, it's like what I fall asleep to. Um, right now I'm like watching this one called 'High School of the Dead'.\n",
    "And it's super cool.I just got done watching 'Assassination Classroom' not too long ago. I really like 'Soul Eater', 'Blue Exorcist', that's what I have on my nails right now. Shout out to my nail girl, Coca.\n",
    "I really like, I love love love 'My Hero Academia' Everybody knows that, I'm total Roku team.I really love 'Hunter x Hunter'. I really love 'Attack on Titan' I'm just a little weeb, I cannot live without music, it's just like anime.\n",
    "Like I literally wake up to it, I go to sleep to it, but music is just something that's very consistent in my life, like all the time I'm either rapping or listening to somebody else rap.\n",
    "It's always been a big part of my life and I definitely cannot see myself surviving without music. I'm a huge PARTYNEXTDOOR fan. Earlier I was probably listening to some Dom Kennedy.\n",
    "I love Dom Kennedy. And I'm always listening to like, UGK. Pimp C's my favorite rapper. Uh, I always listen to Biggie. Yes, because Tony Snow is Pimp C so I am the female Pimp C so it's only right that I'm Tina Snow.\n",
    "So, I absolutely positively cannot live without these people. Like, I would not be able to carry out my day if I didn't have Kelsey, if I didn't have Kellan, if I didn't have 4oe, if I didn't have T Farris, if I didn't have EJ, they just definitely get me together from head to toe.\n",
    " And just as crazy as I am, that's just how crazy they are, if they're not worse. They're like my family, they are my family. And me and Kelsey been knowing each other for a long time, since like 2013.\n"]

    "And this is the only thing a lot of people can use. And I used to have acne. Bad okay. And this really got me through my tough time.\n",
    "So I would definitely recommend this. If you got oily skin and if you're having a bad breakout,this always just calms my face down. Oh I lied girl.\n",
    "I didn't even wipe the makeup off. I lied to y'all. This first. It's Neutrogena makeup wipes. This is what will get all the hot girl stuff off your face.\n",

    "I was sick of going to the class with smudge mascara. So this definitely was a little, easy fix. Now you use the Cetaphil. This is just like the icing on the cake.\n",
    "This is how you start becoming your best self. Apparently the boys like me better with no makeup. But I really don't care what the boys think.\n",
    "I like me. Take me as I am. Or don't take me at all. Try not to drown. In the sink. Okay. Now that you dry, boom! Moisturizing cream.\n",
    "Cause you don't wanna be dry. You always wanna keep it wet. Moist. This is La Mer moisturizing cream. And you know this is kinda bougie.\n",

    "She's like yeah I'm at the dermatologist getting a facial. I'm like girl that look like a murder. So scared of that. And then I have a little bit of, hyperpigmentation.\n",
    "And for me, cause I told y'all I used to have bad acne. I put a little Bio oil on my cheeks cause it like gets rid of dark marks.\n",
    "You can put it on anything. Cause it gets rid of like scars in general. And then your girl brush her teeth. That's about it. You gotta cover the whole toothbrush with the toothpaste.\n",
    "Don't half do it. Don't put a dot, a drip squirt. No girl. The whole thang. You can't half way brush  your teeth.\n",
    "Covering the whole toothbrush is important because, how you gon get enough toothpaste in your mouth to make your breath smell good?\n",
    "How you gonna be laying to bed witcha your boo? Breath smelling like all day.That ain't gon cut.So I just kinda do like a rinse over for everything. First. You gotta go back in.\n",
    "One more time fill up the whole tooth brush. Cause now you gotta brush your tongue.My Mom taught me the importance of brushing my tongue.\n",
    "Because your tongue is really the key to good breath. And I do this a lot. So like, my tongue gotta be, ready to go, all the time.\n",
    "Okay so, after I get out of the shower, I like to make sure my whole body is moisturized. And you know sometimes I can get a little ashy and I didn't wanna be ashy.\n",
    "I wanna be moist all the time. So, I put this on. And this is literally like the equivalent to Vaseline. And it literally keeps me moisturized until the next day all day long.\n",
    "Hotties go get this. Like you probably only need to use this like one time. And then like you're good for like a week. I'm not even joking.\n",
    "When my skin started clearing up, hell no I don't fall asleep with makeup on. Cause once you get to a good level with your skin, cause your skin wanna fight you sometimes.\n",
    "So when you finally win the fight you don't wanna do nothing to get beat up again. So, My dermatologist definitely put me on, because at first I was just living life, drinking dark liquor, eating sugar.\n",
    "Not wiping my makeup off at night. And I went to the dermatologist and I'm like what's wrong with my skin? And she like girl what's wrong with you? So I was like well yeah.\n",
